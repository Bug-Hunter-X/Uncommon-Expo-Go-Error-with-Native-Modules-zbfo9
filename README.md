# Uncommon Expo Go Error with Native Modules

This repository demonstrates a rare error encountered when using Expo Go with a native module.  The error message itself is unhelpful, often pointing to a problem within the native module's configuration or compatibility.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a potential solution.

**Key Issues:**

* Inconsistent or incorrect native module configuration.
* Version mismatches between the Expo SDK, native module, and potentially other dependencies.
* Bugs within the native module itself.

This example focuses on addressing potential configuration and compatibility issues, which are often the root causes of this cryptic error.  Thorough debugging may be required to pinpoint the exact cause in your specific scenario.
