The solution depends on the root cause. Here are some steps to investigate and solve the issue:

1. **Verify Native Module Configuration:**
   - Double-check the native module's installation and configuration within your Expo project. Ensure it is correctly linked and integrated according to its documentation.
   - Check for any platform-specific instructions (Android/iOS). 

2. **Version Compatibility:**
   - Ensure that the native module is compatible with your current Expo SDK version. Refer to the native module's documentation for supported SDK versions.
   - Check for any updates to both the Expo SDK and the native module. 

3. **Clean and Rebuild:**
   - Sometimes, a clean build can resolve issues stemming from cached dependencies or build artifacts. Try cleaning your project and performing a fresh build: `expo prebuild --clean`

4. **Examine Logs:**
   - Thoroughly examine the logs produced during the Expo Go build process. Look for more detailed error messages or warnings that might offer clues.

5. **Isolate the Problem:**
   - If possible, try to create a minimal reproducible example to pinpoint the specific issue. This can help in isolating the problem and effectively debugging the native module integration.

6. **Check for known issues:**
   - Consult the community forums or the native module's issue tracker to see if others have encountered a similar problem and found a solution.
