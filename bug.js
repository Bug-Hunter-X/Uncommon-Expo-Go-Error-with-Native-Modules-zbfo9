This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses a native module. The error message is not very helpful, but it usually indicates that there is a problem with the native module itself. This can be due to several reasons such as an incorrect configuration of the native module, a mismatch between the versions of the native module and the Expo SDK, or a bug in the native module itself.
